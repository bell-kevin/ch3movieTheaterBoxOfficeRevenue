A movie theater only keeps 80% of the revenue earned from ticket sales; the other 20% goes to the distributor. Write a program that calculates the gross revenue (total value of all tickets sold), distributor's portion (20% of the gross revenue), and net revenue for the theater (80% of the gross revenue). Ask the user for the name of the movie, the number of adult tickets sold, and the number of child tickets sold. An adult ticket costs $10, a child ticket is $6. Display a report like this:
