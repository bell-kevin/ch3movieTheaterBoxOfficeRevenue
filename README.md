# movie1
A movie theater only keeps 80% of the revenue earned from ticket sales; the other 20% goes to the distributor. Write a program that calculates the gross revenue (total value of all tickets sold), distributor's portion (20% of the gross revenue), and net revenue for the theater (80% of the gross revenue). Ask the user for the name of the movie, the number of adult tickets sold, and the number of child tickets sold. An adult ticket costs $10, a child ticket is $6. Display a report like this:

Ch 3 Box Office example

Format the money values with 2 decimal places that always display, and be sure the dollar sign appears. Use spaces in the output to line up the dollar signs.

Run the project twice with different values and take screenshots of the results.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
